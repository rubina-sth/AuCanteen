# Description

This project focuses on ordering food online from the ABAC cafeteria. It is a web-based system. The system is designed for 4 different stake holders - Students/Faculty Members, Shop Owner, Cashier Staff and the Admin. The shop owners can add the food items in the menu and the customers (students, faculty members) can easily place an order simply through the website. Customers can top-up balance in their e-wallet provided by the system and use it to order food anytime. This system can be very useful mainly for the customers and shop owners. It eliminates all the hassles of having to use coupons. Furthermore, it also reduces the problem of having the go to the canteen every time to see the food menu by providing the service of viewing food menu beforehand in the website itself.
